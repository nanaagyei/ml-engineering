**Machine Learning Journey Repository**
=====================================

Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey Repository!

This repository serves as a central hub for my learning journey in machine learning, deep learning, and related technologies. I'm committed to dedicating at
least one hour a day to coding and experimenting with various projects to improve my understanding of these topics.

**Repository Overview**
-------------------

The primary goal of this repository is to:

1. Document my progress and experiences as I learn about machine learning and related fields.
2. Share knowledge and insights gained through experimentation and project work.
3. Showcase completed projects and code snippets that demonstrate my understanding of various techniques and tools.

**Project Structure**
------------------

The repository will be organized into the following top-level directories:

### 01_projects

* A collection of completed projects, including:
	+ **Classification**: Image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MNIST dataset, etc.
	+ **Regression**: Simple regression models for housing prices, stock prices, etc.
	+ **Clustering**: K-means clustering on the Iris dataset
	+ **Recommendation Systems**: A simple movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering

### 02_experiments

* A directory for ongoing experiments and prototypes, including:
	+ **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA): Exploring various datasets using pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
	+ **Model Tuning**: Experimenting with different hyperparameters and architectures for classification tasks
	+ **Data Augmentation**: Implementing data augmentation techniques for image classification

### 03_tools_and_resources

* A collection of tools, libraries, and resources used throughout my learning journey:
	+ **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
	+ **Data Science Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.
	+ **Useful Resources**: Online courses, tutorials, books, blogs, etc.
